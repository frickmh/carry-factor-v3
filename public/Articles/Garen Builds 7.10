Descriptions:

Bami's > Warmog's: Battering Ram Garen. A build I was starting to flesh out just before Bork meta hit. It could be worth discussing since Bork is getting nerfed hard next patch. The goal was to get 3k HP ASAP, group early, and abuse Warmog's Regen. It was my anti-tank build at the time. Graps hits like a truck with this build. It worked because Garen could out-perform tanks in mid-game skirmishes 2v2 or 3v3, and his regen and durability would let him force down outer turrets. Mallet > Warmog's or Jaurim's > Warmog's might be the build now that Sunfire got nerfed.

Full Tank: We all know what Full Tank Garen is. Min/max your build for durability, while having just enough damage to kill minions. Throw in a Cleaver somewhere. Full Tank Garen is designed to soak damage and enemy cooldowns. Appropriate if you're the sole frontline for your team, especially if the enemy team has lots of pick. Full Tank Garen is designed for grouping against comps with Assassins, Bruisers, Marksmen, and Mages, and has a noticeable damage fall-off late game, in exchange for maximizing durability. Full Tank Garen can't 100-0 Assassins and Bruisers like other builds can, his job is to zone. This means he's not particularly effective against divers. Also, against teams with a true Tank, Full Tank Garen can tend to be pretty useless since he doesn't deal enough damage to kill them, and their CC is a lot more useful thank Garen's is. A dedicated, meta tank like Galio or Gragas will be much more durable than Garen, giving superior damage soaking ability, while also providing key lockdown and disruption that Garen just can't match no matter how he builds.

BC: All-rounder that gives reasonable damage, utility, and durability. Mediocre against Tanks and okay vs Bruisers in lane. Build path is pretty nice. Struggles against lane bullies, and doesn't do much vs Assassins. Becomes useful in teamfights due to shred and CDR. Use with Grasp, Fervor, or Thunderlord's.

- Titanic: The King of Burst. The Bush Check Special. Excellent vs Divers and Assassins, it's mid-game burst is insane, while still offering decent durability. You'll be able to one-shot squishies throughout the game, while still being pretty tanky. Works best in skirmishes when you can triple autoattack someone that dives and stays in range. Struggles against high CC comps and vulnerable to kiting. Late game you can deal enough damage to carry a teamfight, however you're quite immobile and need your targets to stay stationary. The quintessential Juggernaut build, going Titanic will leave you slightly too squishy to be a bona fide tank. Use with Fervor for maximum team-melting potential.

 - 1-2 Longswords > Zz'rot > Triforce > movespeed: The Split-Push Special. Speaking of how hard Tanks screw over Garen in Teamfights, let's try to prevent the enemy team from getting a clean 5v5! The Split Push build is designed to draw pressure, kill towers, and run away. Unlike most Split Push builds, Garen can't make good use of Lifesteal or Attack Speed, so this Split Push build is focused on PvE, and will be weak against champions in 1v1's or teamfights, however you will be very sticky, so you'll be able to kill the Tank you're splitting against or a Villain if they overextend. As soon as the enemy tank tries to join a teamfight, you go hard on the Tower and drop your Zz'rot. It's important to let your team know you're trying to split. It's important to note that this build ONLY is good for splitting, it sucks at everything else. Use this build to carry through macro play, since you won't get fed or snowball.

 Kalkage: "Guardian Angel: I consider this an offensive item because of the build path. You want that early power spike from BF, but also a bit of tankyness goes a long way. You also survive ganks much more easily. You get focused way less and you are able to dive your enemies all game. I think Tiamat + GA is the current best path for Garen. I do not need the cool down reduction at all, and by going GA, it puts your enemy in a weird situation. On one hand, they cannot kill you, and jungle ganks become weak. On the other hand, they also want that item, but it is not as efficient on them. The enemy top laner wants their CDR or defensive item or offensive item. So if they do go GA as well, they are much weaker than what they could have been. "

 Ghostblade > Dead Men's: The Snowball Build. I haven't tested this build sufficiently so I'll just list what I know. Please fill me in on any details I miss. (Some variants include IE and Tiamat). This build lets you solo kill your opponents and get fed. I don't know how it works if you get behind. I don't know in what situations it falls off. I don't know if you want to group or split. I don't know what comps it's good with/against, or in what situations you would chose this build over the others. I just know it's good for killing stuff, and has great mobility. Usually Stormraider's to stick on mobile targets. Any information about this build is appreciated!

 Tiamat > GA: Supposedly a pretty good build, I haven't tested it. A very early power spike, seems great against AD opponents. Not sure if T-lords or Stormraider's is better here. Any info on what situations you'd use this build, comps, strengths/weaknesses would be appreciated.

 Ghostblade->Tabi->Cleaver->Deadman->Steraks->GA with stormraider/thunderlords.
