                <br><b>About me</b><br>
                I am an avid League of Legends player, a 3 year veteran of Solo Queue, and an independent software developer from MN, USA.  I hold a dual degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering and during my studies took up an interest in software development.  I am currently ranked Diamond 4 on the NA server, and I currently main Garen (Seju when I jungle).  When I learned about the Riot API I knew I had to put my skills to use in order to create something great for the League of Legends community.
                <br><br>
                <b>‘The Struggle’ (Motivation)</b><br>
                Champion Select is a crucial time for anyone wanting to climb the Solo Queue ladder, and the decisions you make there have a significant bearing on the outcome of the game.  A player has only a few short minutes to determine which champions need to be banned, what role they want to play, and then decide which champion they want to pick in order to build a functional team comp while counter picking their lane opponent.  While software tools currently exist to research your team and counter pick the enemy, using those tools while in the game lobby during those crucial few minutes can be unwieldy, and you might not have enough time to use all information available in a meaningful way in order to make correct decisions in the pick/ban phase.  
                <br><br>Added to the challenge is communication.  Your teammates don’t always speak a common language to the standard needed to communicate effectively, or may be unwilling or unable to communicate with you due to a number of reasons, whether it’s being engaged in the aforementioned research, being AFK to get food or to calm an impatient cat, playing another game, or doing something completely different.  Anyone who has played Solo Queue for any length of time has experienced a situation where they have only a few seconds to decide which champion to ban, then end up banning a teammates' main champion, or deciding which of two roles you can pick, and choosing one, only to learn their absent teammate only plays the role you picked.  Anyone who has ever been in those situations quickly learned that a suboptimal pick/ban phase can lead to suboptimal team function in game.

                <b>‘Pave the Way’ (My product)</b><br>

                <b>‘The Future Will Be Bright’ (Future plans)</b><br>
                Carry-Factor.com is a relatively new site, but I hope to make it into a one-stop shop for everything you need from the moment you accept the match to the moment your champion spawns on the Rift.  I’ve got plenty of ideas I want to implement over the following weeks, but if you have any ideas about what you might like to see included or changed on this site, or just want to give me general feedback, please do not hesitate to contact me to let me know!  This site is designed to help you, the player, first and foremost.  Summoners, good luck on the Rift.  Power Slam!
