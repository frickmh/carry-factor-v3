<p>Garen is a fast, durable frontliner with pretty good damage.  While his laning phase is pretty mediocre, if he survives until the teamfighting phase, Garen offers immense zone presence for your backline.</p>
    
<p>Garen has many roles he can fill, depending on the team comps, and whether he is ahead or behind.</p>

<p>Garen's strongest playstyle, in my opinion, is screening and zoning. Garen walks just in front of his team, baiting skillshots, poke, tower hits, and burst with his W. 
    I usually take a LOT of damage this way, but can regenerate it with my passive. If the enemy jumps in, silence any assassins or bruisers diving your carry, and burst them out. 
    As the teamfight progresses, Garen can chase people down if you've won, or draw people away and waste their time if you've lost (Garen is very hard to catch and kill). 
    The Zone and Screen playstyle is very effective, even if you got very behind in lane (which often happens).</p>

<p>Garen is also a competent split pusher. He can easily clear waves with E and Sunfire, and his speed and tankiness allow him to draw a lot of map pressure relatively safely.</p>

<p>Then, of course, there is the Bronze Garen strategy we all know and love of running down the enemy carries and spinning to win. Garen is great at hunting down and killing isolated enemies if you are ahead. 
    It's very important to switch to one of the other two playstyles if you are not snowballing though!</p>

    What are the core items to be built on him?

The MOST IMPORTANT items on Garen are Dead Man's and Swifties with Alacrity. If you don't have Dead Man's and Swifties, you won't be able to do your job, which is run people down or run away. Every other item is secondary to these two. You can't always rush them first, though.

    What is the order of leveling up the skills?

Max E if you can fight back, otherwise max Q (Which is most matchups).

E is good against bruisers and tanks (Irelia, Jax, Nautilus, Malphite, Rammus, Voli).

Q is good against ranged, or champs that you cannot trade against (Like Renekton or Darius, or Riven due to mobility). Q gives you mobility and the ability to safely execute cannon minions.

Because putting points into E only slightly increases it's ratios and base damage, and most of the scaling comes from levels, you only lose a few percent damage (~6%) by leaving it with one point.

Sometimes I'll max Q and E side by side. Max W last in every situation.

    What are his spikes in terms of items or levels?

Garen is very weak early game, only winning a few matchups. Expect to lose lane, particularly if you blind pick, since he has so many lane counters.

Start with a Doran's Shield or Doran's Blade depending on how hard the lane is. Cloth 4 can be OK against oppressive matchups where your opponent took Armor Pen. You'll often have to get Spectre's Cowl, Bami's, or Chain Vest first to survive laning phase. Phage is OK if you are snowballing.

For midgame, you might have to finish Spirit Visage against oppressive AP pokers like Teemo or Kennen, but once you get it, you will be unkillable. Against AD heavy teams, you'll usually want Dead Man's and Sunfire. This will give you enough damage to be relevant in the mid game while leaving you very durable and mobile.

You're starting to spike when you finish Dead Man's, Swifties, and Bami's or Phage. You'll continue to scale through the game, spiking again when you finish Cleaver. You'll remain strong for the rest of the game, hitting your last spike at Level 16 when you get free Warmog's passive, and falling off only slightly at Level 17/18 as ADC's finish their last item.

Maw, Sterak's, Spirit Visage, Randuin's, Thornmail, and once in a blue moon Titanic Hydra are good items to finish your build with.

    What are the most optimal rune/mastery setups?

Runes and masteries depend heavily on your lane opponent and the opposing team comp.

Runes:

Flat Armor Yellows against everyone, MR/Scaling MR Blues depending on your opponent's damage type.

Reds and Quints have more variation.

Against an easier lane, AD + Arpen will give you great damage. You could even go 19 Arpen if you know you can win lane. Arpen works great if you start Doran's Blade.

Against harder lanes, 15 AD can help you get CS, this works great if you started Doran's Shield.

Against very hard ranged matchups, or against very kitey team comps, take AD reds and Movement Speed Quints. The Movespeed will help you maintain range, juke skillshots, and scales well too.

Against the very hardest lane matchups, like Pantheon, you might need to take Regen Quints to stay in lane.

Masteries:

Usually 12/0/18, once in a while 12/18/0 if I know I must fight early. Because of Garen's weak laning, I take masteries that give me lots of sustain. Against easier lanes, I'll take greedier masteries.

Key sustain masteries are Feast, 2% Lifesteal/Vamp, and 2.0 HP/5. Against easy lanes I'll take Double Edged Sword and extra bonus resist.

Grasp of the Undying is great on Garen because he gets sustain, and likes to stack health. I'll get Thunderlord's when I take Cunning tree.

Resolve tree scales better than Cunning because the 15% Tenacity makes you harder to peel, and the reduced SS cooldowns give you more flashes. You want your Flash up as much as possible because often it's the only way you'll ever get onto a carry.

    What champions does he synergize well with?

For some reason, I always seem to win with Master Yi on my team. They don't have any inherent synergy, but I think having two fast, tough to slow bruisers running over the backline is very hard to deal with. Speed champs like Zilean or Lulu seem to work great with this comp as well.

In a more standard setup, Garen is great for peeling for immobile, long ranged hypercarries like Jhin or Lux.

Garen needs CC on his team if he wants to go on the offense, though. I always like seeing a Blitz on my team, Leona, Thresh, and Nautilus are also great at starting fights for Garen. Champs with long-ranged snares like Morg or Nami work well too. Even Sona can help Garen soak up damage.

    What is the counterplay against him?

The best way to beat Garen is to shut him down early. Picking a lane bully can prevent him from running away with the game. Because Garen spikes so late, he's often powerless to affect the game if Bot Lane loses hard.

An aggressive jungler can either shut down Bot and Jungle before Garen can do anything. Garen is also susceptible to tower dives if he is low.
